[0:00] Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
[0:15] Now it looks as though they're here to stay
[0:30] Oh, I believe in yesterday

[0:45] Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
[1:00] There's a shadow hanging over me
[1:15] Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[1:30] Why she had to go I don't know
[1:45] She wouldn't say
[2:00] I said something wrong
[2:15] Now I long for yesterday
